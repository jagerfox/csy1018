RYAN MITCHELL WEBSITE 


HOW I MADE IT
---------------------

FIRST I STARTED OF WITH CREATING THE BASE HTML LAYOUT FOR MY "INDEX.HTML"
MY MAIN PAGE BECAUSE FROM THERE I USED THE
BASE PAGE TO MAKE THE REST OF THE WEBSITE AND JUST EDITED THE PAGE AND CODE NEEDED

AFTER THANK I STARTED TO DESIGNED THE MAIN PAGE TO LOOK SIMPLE AND
EASY TO USE WHILE LOOKING PROFESSIONAL, THE MAIN PAGE IS LINKED
TO "CV.HTML","BIO.HTML"AND "CONTACT.HTML" AS I SAID BEFORE I STARTED
WITH THE INDEX AND WORK MY WAY THOUGH THE PAGES
