           Ryan regularly enjoys seeing what he can breaking from computers to
           code and even games (Seeing how many Bugs can make you win the game or even crash it)
         </p>
         <p>
           Thankfully he also loves figuring out how put them back together and get them working again.
           He naturally blames it on all that Lego and games as a child, but it seemingly made him a great designer too.
         </p>
         <p>
           A problem solver and inquisitive by nature he may be, but he also enjoys being a team leader and
           play many team games with his friends mosty Real Time Strategy.
           He also has a huge love for japan and japanese culture
         </p>
         <p>
           He can usually found buried deep in designing Jamming out to the hits of Bring me the horizon or
           A day to remember thinking nobody else can hear him, or at comic con cosplaying charters from games, films and animes.
         </p>
         <p>
           Sometimes though he loves nothing better than simply relaxing with his significant other
           and playing pool and having a couple of drinks.
         </p>
         <p>
           Code, pop figures, cats, dogs, food and coca cola ... that sums him up.
